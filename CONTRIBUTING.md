# Contributing to ImSplorer

Thank you for considering contributing to ImSplorer, a custom shell that replaces explorer.exe with a custom one using Dear ImGui. This project is a work in progress and is very unstable, so you probably shouldn't use it. But if you want to, you can download the source code and compile it yourself and contribute to the project as you see fit. Thanks for stopping by!
