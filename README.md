Hey excited user! Glad you're here. This is a custom shell that replaces explorer.exe with a custom one using Dear ImGui. This is a work in progress and is very unstable so you probably shouldn't use it. But if you want to, you can download the source code and compile it yourself and contribute to the project as you see fit. Thanks for stopping by!
